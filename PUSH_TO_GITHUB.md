# Push to GitHub - Instructions

After creating the repository on GitHub (https://github.com/new), run these commands:

## Step 1: Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)

```bash
cd /Users/somayshsadani/Ashwagandha
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ashwagandha.git
```

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: If you already have the repository URL

Just replace `YOUR_USERNAME/ashwagandha` with your actual GitHub username and repository name in the commands above.
